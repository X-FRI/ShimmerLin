# AutumnBot（铁暮秋）

> A Framework for Bridging the Digital and Physical Worlds

AutumnBot is a powerful robot framework designed to connect anything within the digital realm to the physical world.

At its core, `autumn-core` is a NestJS service built with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. It serves as the central hub, allowing peripheral services to connect and communicate over the network. This core handles the fundamental logic and coordination, enabling the framework's extensive capabilities.

Key Features:

*   **Robust Core:** Built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, ensuring a scalable and maintainable application.
*   **Domain-Driven Design:** Structured using DDD principles for clear separation of concerns and better manageability of complex domains.
*   **Network Communication:** Designed for seamless communication with various peripheral services over the network.
